## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This project allowed me to get more experience with the JS aspects of web development. I was able to switch out components with the JS to have a more interactive complete product. 

### Continued development

I would like to look into more radial gradient attributes because it seems to give a subtle effect that makes components look much more polished than plain colors.
